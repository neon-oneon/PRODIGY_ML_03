The task for the third project of Prodigy Infotech's Machine Learning Internship is to create a SVM [Support Vector Machine] and using that to identify if the given animal is a cat or a dog. 

I have used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats?select=train) Dataset from Kaggle.

Attached is Jupyter notebook with code as well as documentation explaining in detail how to achieve the desired output.

I have also attached the outputs for this particular SVM.

An SVM can be executed by following the given steps:

> Import libraries

> Load Dataset

> Split the dataset into training and testing sets

> Standardize the features to improve performance

> Train the model

> Make Predictions

> Evaluate the model

The code I have used rendered a maximum accuracy of 0.887.
